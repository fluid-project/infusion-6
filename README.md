## Who Makes Infusion, and How Can I Help? ##

The Fluid community is an international group of designers, developers, and testers who focus on a common mission:
improving the user experience and accessibility of the open web.

## Inclusion ##

The Fluid community is dedicated to inclusive design&mdash;design that considers the full range of human diversity with respect to ability, language, culture, gender, age and other forms of human difference. To help ensure that our community is a safe space for all contributors, we have adopted a [code of conduct](https://wiki.fluidproject.org/display/fluid/Inclusion+in+the+Fluid+Community) based on the [Contributor Covenant](http://contributor-covenant.org/). All participants and contributors have the responsibility to uphold this code. Please contact the [Advocacy working group](mailto:fluid-advocacy@fluidproject.org) if you encounter unacceptable behaviour.

## Where is Infusion Used? ##

Infusion is the cornerstone of a number of Fluid's own projects dedicated to supporting inclusive design on the Web. You
can see some of them featured on our [Projects page](http://fluidproject.org/projects.html). Infusion is also used in a
variety of third-party applications, which are listed on the
[Infusion Integrations](https://wiki.fluidproject.org/display/fluid/Infusion+Integrations) wiki page.
